        review: '“Our house is located in Ambur, 200 kms away from Chennai. We came to know about Arcmen via Google. We contacted Mr. Balaraman. He responded very quickly. Highly knowledgeable right from start to end. After finalizing the 3D design and confirming the drawing details, they executed the same as in the design. Arcmen team did a wonderful job to make our new home look perfect with their interior works. We really appreciate the Arcmen interior design team for their sincerity and perfection in work. Thank you.”',

        review: 'The team discussed a range of designs for the layout we had in the kitchen as well as bedrooms and came up with many options, following which they also guided on materials selection and fittings with a clear focus. Very satisfied with the work. Delivery – given the variety handled some delays (few days) must be accepted. Overall very happy with the fit and finish of the work. Work completed in May 2023.',

        review: 'Arcmen Interiors – interior designers in chennai : They have a very good knowledge in the field. They keep Customer service in front and steering the wheel and that is their success. They even suggest creative ideas when we are blank. We did a complete modular kitchen and it really came out well. Nobody is perfect and they should have a backup plan when the staffs are unavailable.Our 3D design got a bit delayed because of Staff not available but still they have managed to complete it as promised. Thanks to the whole team. Great work indeed.',

        review: 'Arcmen approach was very customer friendly, providing lot of good suggestions about the interior even if you don’t have any idea on the same.Their 3d design output was very helpful in realising the final output of our interior design which also helps us in making final changes accordingly. Importantly their workers are very dedicated and disciplined completing the work on time. Project manager Mr.Balaraman was very approachable and used to have frequent visits during site work and provides lot of suggestions. Overall I am completely satisfied with the work they have done. Thanks Arcmen!',
